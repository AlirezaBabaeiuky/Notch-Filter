# Notch-Filter
In this repository, Band-Stop (Notch) filter and some internal dynamics of second-order systems are studied. 
In mechatronics systems, Excitatoin point and Measurement points are of major interest. If the measurement point coincides with the excitation point (injection), this is called: Collocated measurement, otherwise this is Non-collocated measurement. Main difference is in terms of Linear System Stability. From Classical controls engineering, it is understood that for a stable system, the manitude should be below 0 dB and phase should be greater than '-180' degrees. Certaintly, the closer to these points the less stability margins we have. 
This is inferred from the fact that Frequency Response of a system is essentially a Complex number and the closed-loop response is like: TF_CL = (G_plant * G_Controller) / (1+ G_plant * G_controller); such a transfer function has denominator as Charateristics equation which determines the stability of the response. Physicall interpretation is: a system is unstale if the response blows up (diverges unboundedly).
